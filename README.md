<h1 align="center">Hello! I'm Shervan Shahparnia</h1>

# About Me
I recently completed my B.S. in Data Science at San Jos√© State University and am now pursuing an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence at SJSU. My graduate coursework spans artificial intelligence, data engineering, operating system design, and the mathematical foundations of ML/AI/software systems. I am actively exploring applications of machine learning and the integration of advanced math into intelligent systems. My passion lies in applied research, scalable software design, and bridging theory with practical solutions.

## What I'm Up To
- Advancing personal research projects in Human Activity Recognition (HAR), leveraging time- and frequency-domain feature extraction with models including KNN, SVM, and Random Forest.  
- Delivering freelance web development and full-stack solutions using modern frameworks such as React, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Flask to support clients and small businesses.  
- Exploring machine learning applications in predictive modeling, with projects such as accident severity prediction using PyTorch, supported by statistical testing and visualization.  
- Continuously refining my personal portfolio website, [shervan-portfolio.vercel.app](https://shervan-portfolio.vercel.app/). I've built a new one with the same frameworks/languages with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, to showcase technical projects, research, and development expertise.
